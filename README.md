### Compile and link a C/C++ program
To compile a C source file you can use the GNU gcc compiler (or the cc compiler for C programs)

$ gcc HelloWorld.c

The output of the compilation by default is an executable file a.exe. In order to name the
executable file like the source code you can use the command

$ gcc HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld

C++ source code can be compiled using the GNU g++ compiler.
### Run a program
